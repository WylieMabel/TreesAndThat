Minits – 1st meeting (27.10, 15:15) (minute taker: Benni)

1.	Chat a bit about what we want the project to be

    a.	Agro-forests – but only modelling the natural system would be a bit boring (moisture flux and that’s it)
  	
    b.	So it would be nice to do some coupling to social system – e.g., modelling adoption of this farming method etc. Farms would            then be SD models, while farmers would be Agents
  	
    c.	Could model community-wide benefits of increased adoption (i.e., resilience)
  	
3.	How do we want to divide up work as a team?
   
    a.	Probably need to get a start on the work to see how much work every part is and what everyone’s interested in. Mabel and             Marina are probably best at Coding, Benni the physical science bits and Ali the social science bits – but we will have to            see!
5.	How do we want to store data and minutes etc.?
   
    a.	GitHub would be nice!
  	
7.	How do we want to start off the project? Use preexisting model or code from ground up?
   
    a.	Could use e.g., lake – social system model as a starting point as we might want to do something conceptually similar
  	
    b.	Might be able to take some inspiration from the ODDs we did for CW1 just to get a start
  	
9.	What to do next?
    
    a.	All start reading papers etc. Ali to send some links. Everyone to let people know what paper they are reading (could have a          list of papers in a word doc and everyone marks what they’re doing)
  	
        i.	Catholic relief services has a page listing relevant papers -> scan through that
  	
        ii.	Mabel focus: look into how to set up a hybrid SD-ABM model in terms of NL implementation and science
  	
        iii.	N.B.: connectedpapers.com and paperswithcode are really good to find papers
  	
        iv.	Need to formulate a question!
  	
        v.	It will be difficult to find data that constrains parameters
  	
    b.	Mabel to set up GitHub
  	
    c.	Benni to set up shared Overleaf doc for working on the write-up
  	
11.	Next meeting: next week two of us are away, so potentially online meeting next week. Marina back next weekend, Ali the following Wednesday -> would have to meet after that
12.	For day-to-day work: Start a Kanban board on GitHub to keep track of what everyone is doing.
