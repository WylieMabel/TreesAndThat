# Climate Resilience in Central America’s ‘Dry Corridor’:
## Modelling the Effectiveness and Adoption of Water-Conserving Farming Practices
### Group: TreesAndThat

This repository contains group work for the course "Modelling of Systems for Sustainability". The final assignment was to partake in a research project using agent-based modelling to work collaboratively and accountably with other students to formulate, explore and communicate a sustainability system model.

Our project presents a coupled social-ecohydrological model to study the spread of Water Smart Agriculture (WSA) among vulnerable smallholder farmers in Central America's Dry Corridor. The model combines an agent-based social system (modelled in Netlogo) with a Python ecohydrological model (calculating soil moisture/harvest). Initial results suggest WSA can spread quickly if farmers can easily perceive a neighbour's benefits. Of the variables tested, only the initial number of farmers using WSA had a statistically significant effect on the speed of adoption.

The folder 'Final Submission' contains the documents submitted detailing group work evidence, but more importantly, the code folder which can be used to replicate the experiments.
